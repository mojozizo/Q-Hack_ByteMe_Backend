# Q-Hack_ByteMe_Backend
A ACE alternative project

### Problem:
The platform should extract structured data (e.g., founder background, funding history, tech stack), assess each startupâ€™s potential using ML and NLP techniques (such as LLMs), and present the discovered insights

Bonus points for stretch goals like founder track record analysis, real-time demo features, or LLM-powered chat interfaces.

### Workflows:
- Extraction - Extract information from pitch decks and websites
- Evaluation - Cross check the given information within the deck with public websites, social media sites which include checks if a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) is involved or if the individual has any registered legal cases, outstanding fines etc.
- Valuation - Provide scores to the teams based on the evaluation

### Goals:
- Figure out what points do we need to extract from the pdf or do we need the 
???entire pdf in the context window with a chat based application ???

- Figure out the evaluation criterias as well as the workflows within the evaluation pipeline

- Figure out the scoring criteria
